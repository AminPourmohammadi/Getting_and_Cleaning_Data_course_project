## This file explains the experiment and its variables

# A group of 30 volunteers in the age group 19-48 years were selected to perform six activities, wearing Samsung Galaxy S II :
1) Walking
2) Walking_upstairs
3) Walking_downstairs
3) Sitting
4) Standing
5) Laying

# The obtained dataset was partitioned into two sets:
1) train set - 70% of the Volunteers
2) test set - 30 % of the Volunteers

For each set, 561 measurements were made as listed in the "features.txt". 

#For the train set :
1) The 561 measurements are recorded in separate columns in the X_train.txt for all the subjects. 
2) Y_train.txt contains the activity codes for each measurement for every subject. e.g. "1" would correspond to "walking" etc. 
3) subject_train.txt includes the number 1-30 for all the subjects/volunteers

# For the test set :
The corresponding files list the same parameters for the "test" volunteers.
